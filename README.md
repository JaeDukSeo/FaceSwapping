# FunPythonMask

In this project I plan to create a face mask.

## Techology part

I divided this poject into 3 main parts:

* Face detection (using Haar Cascade)
* Keypoint detection (using Haar Cascade or using simple NN)
* Face projection into normal type (using affinity projection or smth else)
* Add template in noraml face and back to original image with changed face

You can see very simple [example](https://pysource.com/2019/03/25/pigs-nose-instagram-face-filter-opencv-with-python/#) of this idea.
